## Framework vs Project Structure in v2.0

**New in v2.0:** UDO is now split into two separate folder hierarchies for multi-LLM safety.

### Why This Matters

When multiple AI assistants work on the same project, isolation is critical. v2.0 separates:

- **`/UDO Framework/`** — The immutable reference files (read-only for your project)
- **`/UDO Project/`** — Your working context (where you read and write)

This prevents AI agents from accidentally modifying framework rules while still allowing project-specific customization.

### Architecture Diagram

```
Your Project Root
├── /UDO Framework/                 ← Immutable reference
│   ├── START_HERE.md               (DO NOT EDIT)
│   ├── ORCHESTRATOR.md             (DO NOT EDIT)
│   ├── HARD_STOPS.md               (DO NOT EDIT)
│   ├── REASONING_CONTRACT.md       (DO NOT EDIT)
│   └── [all other protocol files]

└── /UDO Project/                   ← Your working context
    ├── START_HERE.md               (Read from Framework, can be empty)
    ├── ORCHESTRATOR.md             (Reference Framework)
    ├── HARD_STOPS.md               (Extend Framework rules here)
    ├── PROJECT_STATE.json
    ├── .project-catalog/           (sessions, decisions, history)
    ├── .memory/                    (your facts and working notes)
    ├── .outputs/                   (your deliverables)
    └── [all your project data]
```

### Path Reference Table

| Item | In Framework | In Project |
|------|--------------|-----------|
| Core orchestration rules | `/UDO Framework/ORCHESTRATOR.md` | Read-only reference |
| Hard stops (immutable) | `/UDO Framework/HARD_STOPS.md` | Reference in `/UDO Project/HARD_STOPS.md` |
| Hard stops (project-specific) | N/A | Add HS-UDO-014 through HS-UDO-016 in `/UDO Project/HARD_STOPS.md` |
| Session logs | N/A | `/UDO Project/.project-catalog/sessions/` |
| Decisions | N/A | `/UDO Project/.project-catalog/decisions/` |
| Memory (canonical) | N/A | `/UDO Project/.memory/canonical/` |
| Memory (working) | N/A | `/UDO Project/.memory/working/` |
| Deliverables | N/A | `/UDO Project/.outputs/` |

### Key Rule: HS-UDO-014 (New in v2.0)

**NEVER modify files in `/UDO Framework/`.**

The Framework is the reference copy. It will be updated by the upgrade tool. Your customizations go in `/UDO Project/`.

## ⚠️ Important: Do NOT Use Symlinks

The UDO Framework MUST be a real directory structure, not a symlink.

**Bad:**
```bash
ln -s /actual/location/UDO\ Framework ./UDO\ Framework  # ❌ WRONG
```

**Why:** Framework immutability (HS-UDO-014) requires isolated folder structure. Symlinks break isolation and can cause:
- Multiple projects accidentally sharing Framework modifications
- Loss of Framework immutability guarantees
- Data corruption across projects

**Good:**
```bash
cp -r /template/UDO\ Framework ./UDO\ Framework  # ✓ CORRECT
```

## ⚠️ MANDATORY FIRST STEP

**STOP. Read `ORCHESTRATOR.md` NOW and adopt its protocols before doing anything else.**

Do not proceed until you have:
1. Read ORCHESTRATOR.md completely
2. Understood the SESSION LOGGING requirement (you MUST log every session)
3. Understood CHECKPOINT triggers (auto-save after 3 todos, phase completions)
4. Understood when to CREATE AGENTS (2+ distinct personas needed)
5. Understood the MEMORY SYSTEM (canonical/working/disposable)
6. Understood the DUAL-MODE SYSTEM (RC mode for analysis, Persona mode for delivery)

**Say this before starting work:**
> "I have read ORCHESTRATOR.md and will follow UDO protocol. I understand I must: log sessions, checkpoint progress, create agents when needed, use the memory system, and operate in the correct mode (RC for analysis, Persona for delivery)."

---

## After Reading Orchestrator

Complete these orientation steps:

1. **Check hard stops:** `HARD_STOPS.md` (rules you must NEVER violate)
2. **Check reasoning contract:** `REASONING_CONTRACT.md` (how to think during analysis)
3. **Check current status:** `PROJECT_STATE.json`
4. **Check lessons:** `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` (mistakes to avoid)
5. **Know your environment:** `CAPABILITIES.json`
6. **Check recent sessions:** `.project-catalog/sessions/` (most recent file)
7. **Check bridge status:** `.bridge/bridge-state.json` (if bridge module is active)

## Then Give Your Orientation Report:

> "I've read ORCHESTRATOR.md and REASONING_CONTRACT.md and reviewed the project.
> - **Goal:** [from PROJECT_STATE.json]
> - **Phase:** [current phase]
> - **Last session:** [summary from most recent session log]
> - **Transcript:** [path if exists, or "none"] — offer to review if user wants additional context
> - **Next steps:** [from PROJECT_STATE.json or last session]
> Ready to continue."

## Quick Reference

### Dual-Mode System

| Mode | Use For | Key Rule |
|------|---------|----------|
| **RC Mode** | Analysis, research, decisions | Every claim needs evidence |
| **Persona Mode** | Writing, creating, delivering | Only use facts from RC handoff |

**Flow:** RC Mode → Handoff Packet → Persona Mode → Deliverable

### Session Commands

| Command | What AI Does |
|---------|--------------| 
| `Resume` | Quick resume with oversight report |
| `Deep resume` | Full context with recent sessions |
| `Handoff` | Create session log, update state, end session |
| `Quick handoff` | Minimal session log |
| `Backup` | Run ALL backup/documentation protocols mid-session |
| `Status` | Oversight report only |
| `Backfill sessions` | Reconstruct missing session logs |

### Mode Commands

| Command | What AI Does |
|---------|--------------|
| `RC mode` | Engage Reasoning Contract mode |
| `Analyze [topic]` | RC mode for specific analysis |
| `Persona: [name]` | Switch to persona for delivery |
| `Write [deliverable]` | Persona mode (needs RC handoff first) |

### Command Shortcuts

| Short | Full Command |
|-------|--------------|
| `r` | Resume |
| `dr` | Deep resume |
| `h` | Handoff |
| `qh` | Quick handoff |
| `s` | Status |
| `cp` | Checkpoint this |
| `bf` | Backfill sessions |
| `cc` | Compliance check |
| `br` | Bridge request |
| `cb` | Check bridge |
| `bs` | Bridge status |
| `bu` | Backup (full mid-session save) |

## Rule Hierarchy

| Layer | Location | Override? |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| 0 | `HARD_STOPS.md` | NEVER |
| 0.5 | `REASONING_CONTRACT.md` | NEVER (during analysis) |
| 1 | `.rules/*.md` | With justification |
| 2 | `.agents/*.md` | By orchestrator |
| 3 | `LESSONS_LEARNED.md` | Easily |

## Compliance Checklist

Before starting ANY work, confirm you will:

- [ ] **MANDATORY:** Create session transcript at `/UDO Project/.project-catalog/history/YYYY-MM-DD-HHMM-session-transcript.md` BEFORE accepting first user prompt (see HS-UDO-013)
- [ ] Write/append to transcript in real-time after each response (before accepting next prompt)
- [ ] Log this session to `/UDO Project/.project-catalog/sessions/` before ending
- [ ] Append archive marker to transcript when ending session
- [ ] Auto-checkpoint after every 3 completed todos
- [ ] Create agents if task requires 2+ distinct personas
- [ ] Document major decisions in `/UDO Project/.project-catalog/decisions/`
- [ ] Use memory system for facts discovered during work in `/UDO Project/.memory/`
- [ ] Update `/UDO Project/PROJECT_STATE.json` after completing work
- [ ] Use RC mode for analysis, Persona mode for delivery
- [ ] Create handoff packet before switching from RC to Persona mode
- [ ] **New in v2.0:** NEVER modify files in `/UDO Framework/` — extend rules in `/UDO Project/HARD_STOPS.md` instead
- [ ] **New in v2.0:** When multiple AIs work the same project, read `/UDO Project/PROJECT_STATE.json` before updating (HS-UDO-015)

**If you find yourself working without logging, STOP and catch up.**
**If you find yourself making claims without evidence, STOP and engage RC mode.**
**If you find yourself modifying framework files, STOP — your changes go in `/UDO Project/` instead.**
