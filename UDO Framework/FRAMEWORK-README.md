## Framework Immutability

**This framework folder is read-only and immutable.** Projects reference and inherit from it but do not modify it. All project-specific customizations belong in the UDO Project folder, not here.

Framework updates are coordinated at the repository level and distributed via version management.

## Version
See VERSION file for current framework version.

## Usage

Each project that uses UDO includes a reference to this framework. The framework provides:
1. Standardized session management
2. Protocol definitions for agent behavior
3. Reusable infrastructure and templates
4. Standards for quality and communication

Projects inherit from the framework but maintain their own state, configuration, and customizations in the UDO Project folder.
